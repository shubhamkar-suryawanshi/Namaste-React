When we want scope of variable within component then we use state. It is the local variable.

Prop is value passed from one component to another component. props are like local state for the parent component

Props Drilling - unecessary components get involved and if we update it, all components rerender
React Developer Tools

lifting the state up => 

You need to store the state which will be accessible to everywhere, in central space known as context - It is kind of shared state for whole app and any component can used that data

If we make simple global variables, React is not traking it, no reconcilliation process so no update after render

```
import {createContext} from 'react'

const UserContext = createContext(takes data which we need all across our application)

const UserContext = createContext({
    user : {
    name: 'abc',
    email: 'xyz@mail.com'
    }
})

export default UserContext;
```
```
import {useContext} ...
import UserContext...

const {user} = useContext(UserContext)

and use it anywhere
<h1>{user.name}</h1>
```

then y we need state and props
- context is useState for entire application
- UserContext.Consumer as a component in class based component
- UserContext.Provider to update data acc to api
UserContext.dispalyName = "UserContext"

## 2 types of layer in web application
1. UI layer - View(write inside code - JSX and CSS)
2. Data Layer - (props and states and context...)

these works together, in browser.
