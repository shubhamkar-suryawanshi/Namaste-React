## Framework Vs Library

- Library gives  developers predefined methods and classes which help to work faster and efficient. It also gives complete control of application flow by which we can decide when and where to call specific function and method.
- On other hand, in framework the flow is controlled by framework itslef.
- The intent of framework is to reduce  complexity of software developement process while Intent of library is to provide reusable software functionality.
- React only takes care of View part while Angular takes care of MVC

## Why is React known as React?
